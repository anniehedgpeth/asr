# Azure Site Recovery Lab

This site is for the purpose of tracking my progress in building a suitable lab for testing Azure Site Recovery (ASR).

Both groups will be on one Azure subscription. One resource group will function as the "on-prem" site, and one resource group will function as the failover resource group meant to be in Azure containing the Azure Recovery Vault.
